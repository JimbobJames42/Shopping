	There are many more things the UML implementation 
covers more than my program. It has better error handling, and
makes an interesting connection to the other classes. I was able to better
see how the program would work with the UML more than pure visualization.

	At the same time, the program is not fully complete, which my attempt does
better. For the UML I need to add methods that displays the data. Along with that,
I  have to add connections to that program as well.
